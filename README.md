# Mood Tracker

This app allows you to track your mood everyday for a long period of time, so you can look at your month/year with more perspective. You choose a date, a happy face or a sad one depending on the mood of the day, and a message if you want to remember the good things. All this information is saved to your browser so you can consult it any day and your data will still be there.

This project was developed as a part of the online training for [Adalab](https://adalab.es/) It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
